# Vole Machine Simulator

Vole Machine Simulator is a graphical application built with C++ and the Qt library to simulate a virtual machine environment. The simulator provides an interactive GUI for users to design, configure, and observe the behavior of a virtual machine. This project is ideal for users looking to understand virtual machine architectures, machine instructions, and memory management in a controlled environment.

## Features

- **Machine Instruction Simulation**: Supports custom or predefined sets of machine instructions, enabling step-by-step execution.
- **Memory Management**: Includes memory allocation, deallocation, and visualization of memory states.
- **Register Manipulation**: Users can view and modify register values during runtime.
- **Debugging Capabilities**: Provides breakpoints, step execution, and real-time logging for easy debugging.
- **Arthimatic and logical opertions**: provide AND ,OR,XOR ,Rotate ,and addition using two's complement method ,and addtion using excplicit normalization of floating point values.
- **User-friendly GUI**: Built with Qt, offering an intuitive layout and control panel for easy navigation and interaction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a modern C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- **Qt Library**: Install the latest version of Qt (5.15+ recommended) from [Qtâ€™s official website](https://www.qt.io/download).

### Installation

**Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Michelle-Magdy/Vole-Machine.git
   cd vole-machine-simulator
   ```

### Usage

1. **Load a Program**: Use the **File** menu to load an assembly-like program file into the simulator.
2. **Execute Instructions**: Use controls to step through instructions or run the program continuously.
3. **Monitor States**: Observe registers, memory, and program counter updates in real time.
4. **Set Breakpoints**: Right-click on instructions to set breakpoints for debugging.
